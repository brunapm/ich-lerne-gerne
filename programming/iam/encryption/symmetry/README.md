# Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption

* Symmetric Encryption: Single key shared between hosts
* Asymmetric Encryption: Key pair for each host - public/private
    * If data is encrypted with public key, only the private key can decrypt it
    * If data is encrypted with private key, the public key can decrypt it
