# The DOM

The **Document Object Model** (DOM) is an interface that allows HTML and XML documents to edit a page.
It represents the HTML document with nodes in form of objects, connecting Javascript to HTML.

Javascript allows direct access to the DOM.

## The Virtual DOM

Some front-end frameworks (such as React and Vue.js) create a Virtual DOM where all the elements are displayed and later translated by the framework to the browser's DOM.
